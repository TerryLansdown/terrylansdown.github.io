<a href="http://www.icloud.com/">iCloud</a> offers wonderful promise as a mechanism to free us all from the need to organise and manage our data. Unfortunately, the whole package isn&#8217;t there yet, and that&#8217;s a big problem for the users.  <p>We&#8217;re impoverished, in terms of documentation. For example, what it can do, what it can&#8217;t do; when it will work, and when it won&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s a lot of uncertainty, especially when core to the concept is storing our <strong>precious</strong> data, and presumably without the need to worry about where and what it is. &#8216;Just all available everywhere, when you need it.&#8217; That&#8217;s fine, if it is, but the current release, only really integrates the iOS devices, not the desktop. Now I appreciate that we&#8217;re <em>probably</em> going to be getting more mobile, but, I&#8217;m guessing that most people still produce and manipulate most of their content (90% or more) on the desktop, and many spend most of their working day in front of a computer. Needing to use iTunes or a browser to access iCloud documents, just ain&#8217;t right. If iCloud is going to be of use, it needs to be integrated across devices, and either in a way that there is never any problem (not currently the case) or in a predictable or documented way.</p> <p>Why would anyone use it now? You have to manage your documents to get them on or off the desktop, and then you can&#8217;t be sure you&#8217;ll have them available when you need them. So much more effort than, for example, <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. Let&#8217;s hope that its early-adopter pain, but why didn&#8217;t Apple hold off until all the pieces were in place, given the huge efforts they have clearly made.</p>
