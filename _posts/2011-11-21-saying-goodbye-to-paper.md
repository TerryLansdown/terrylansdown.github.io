One of my university lecturers (from the early nineties) once said &#8220;the paperless office, is about as much use as a paperless toilet&#8221;. I&#8217;m largely in agreement, but in my quest to remove <em>unnecessary</em> paperwork, I&#8217;ve invested in several bits of supporting technology. </p> <p>In summary (with follow up posts as soon as time allows), and in order of anticipated usefulness:</p> <ol><li>a ScanSnap scanner. This is a neat form-feeding duplex scanner, modest desktop footprint and nicely slots into some of the other puzzle pieces, e.g., <a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/products/paperless/">Paperless</a>, <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/">PDFPen</a>, <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>,<a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php"> Hazel</a> and general handling of images and text. Hardware design is good, the software design is functional, if rather utilitarian and a bit, well, ugly.</li><li>a Livescribe &#8216;smart&#8217; pen. I got the 2GB echo, which is an excellent gadget, for my use (I&#8217;m never far from a computer), I have no need of the four or eight GB editions.</li><li>Dragon Express, which I&#8217;m speaking this text with. It&#8217;s got a lot of promise, but v1.0 has its limitations, including a bug with Textexpander, and some other &#8216;error-beep&#8217; bug, I can&#8217;t identify yet.</li></ol>
