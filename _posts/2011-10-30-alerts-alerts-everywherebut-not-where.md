<p>Feature request: harmonised, sync'ed reminders and alerts.</p><p>Reminders and alerts in the Mac Universe are great in many ways. You can set an alarm for an event and no matter which device you're using you can be confident that you'll get that reminder; and there's the rub. If you have more than one 'integrated device', you get your alarm everywhere too, which can be a niggle if you have multiple Macs, iPhones, iPads, etc.</p><p>Lets have an integrated, perhaps device prioritised mechanism for semi-intelligent alerts. When I acknowledge I've 'cleared' an alert on one device, I don't want it on 'all' the others. Or at least, I'd like the option to control that behaviour.</p>
