Pretty as the iBooks are, assuming you are happy with the default options. Its not going to happen, but it would be rather nice if there were tools to use iBooks books on the Mac, PC, iPhone, other devices too. Even the Kindle, if some financial and export mechanism could be determined. Industry standards anyone? Not a lot of uptake so far for FaceTime by other software and devices.
