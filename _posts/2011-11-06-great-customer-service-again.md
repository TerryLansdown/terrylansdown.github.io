On two separate occasions recently, I was trying to use apps, one on the iPhone and one on the Mac, and couldn't find the functions I was looking for. One was a functional change in new version of the software (iCatcher!), while the other was the keyboard shortcut I couldn't find (YoruFukurou). For both, I happened to try tweeting to the developers for advice, and on both occasions within an hour, I'd had quick and helpful replies solving my minor niggles. Just great, personal, helpful, human support. The world has changed and the small independent software developer is king (or Queen!)
