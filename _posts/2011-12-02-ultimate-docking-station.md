<p><a href="http://vr-zone.com/articles/intel-is-planning-docking-solution-for-next-year-s-ultrabooks-using-thunderbolt/14037.html">VR Zone</a> recently reported on a new Intel integrated docking solution, &#8216;Common Housing Connector&#8217; for the Ultrabooks. Franky, this is an ugly looking solution to an interesting problem.<br><img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2011/11/tb_dock_1.jpg" alt="Horrible design" width="500"/></p><p><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/11/25/intel-working-on-standardized-thunderbolt-docking-system-for-pcs/">MacRumors</a> discusses this mentioning the Apple solution, the &#8216;ultimate docking station&#8217;.<br /><img src="http://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2011/07/dock.jpg" alt="Slightly less horrible design" width="500"/><br><br /> Bah, this is an aesthetic, ergonomic mess. Any guesses why the single cable, with bifocating tendrils ended up that way. I&#8217;d put my money on a nasty compromise between:</p><ul><li>a fudge on the Thunderbolt cable to stuff electronics in the (horrifically, suspiciously expensive) cable rather than the devices its connected to; and</li><li>the rather nice, but arkwardly directional Magsafe connnector. Ironically, the old design would have worked better, as both <em>legs</em> would be, at least, pointing the same way. The ergonomic problem these and many other &#8216;straight out&#8217; cables introduces is that they block the space where a mouse or paperwork should be able to comfortably operate constraining the user&#8217;s workspace, not good. Oh, for the 90Â° usb cable adapter! But that's another story.</li></ul><p><CENTER><img src="http://pangea.stanford.edu/~schmitt/magsafe/magsafe.jpg" alt="old design" /></CENTER></p>
