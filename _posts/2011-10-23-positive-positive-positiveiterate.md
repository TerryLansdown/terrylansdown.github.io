Just reflecting on my current ramblings, and I think I might be coming across a little on the negative side. I'm interested in how we can improve the user experience and inherently, its easy to 'pick holes' where others have tried. Any truely successful design needs interation around the user's needs, and that's a predicable part of the process.
