<p>This blog is here for my ramblings about usability, design and human factors. Getting the format and structure right, well not too terrible has been a good example, for me, of the challenges of resisting OCD, while setting up a stucture I’m happy with. In other words, hours of fiddling about for initally very little obvious benefit. Hopefully, the user interface supports focus on the important bit, what I’m thinking about, without getting in your face.<br /><br />Lunacy over the details, which I hope to write about as the time goes by. For example,<br /><ul><li>favicons</li><li>navigation, and getting back to the home screen</li><li>cutting out all the css crap</li><li>fading the non-focus items into the background</li><li>working up a workflow, and yes, trying out the presumed efficiencies from multi-markdown writing</li><li>twitter integration (work in progress)</li></ul>
