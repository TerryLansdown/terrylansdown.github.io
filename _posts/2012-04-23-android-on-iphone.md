Wouldn't it be interesting if we could run Android or iOS on reference hardware, a-la, the x86 desktop processor? I wonder if Apple would sell many iPhones for people to install Android onto the hardware? There seems to be a good number of people running Windows on Apple/Intel hardware. Good or bad for mobile platform development if we had standardised hardware? Wouldn't it be nice to choose the hardware for the OS you prefer. Of course, some might not wish to allow their OS to function with other hardware, HackiPhone anyone?
