My experience of iTunes Match on my slow rural broadband is not good, when bandwidth is tight, i.e., always. When I select a track to stream (well download really), iTunes will fail and skip to the next track; then fail, skip to the next track; then&#8230;err&#8230;fail and skip the next track. Clearly, its comparing download speeds with playback and giving up. Jumping to the next track just isn&#8217;t the behaviour I&#8217;m expecting, and it resets the problem, nnngh.<br /><br />Update: Actually, calmed down a bit now, general performance is good, but when the &#8216;small pipe&#8217; is under stress, it fails badly.
