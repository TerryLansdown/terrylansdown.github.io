Really liked John Gruber's crafting analogy some time back about sensible and appropriate caution before action <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/05/measure_twice">"Daring Fireball: Measure Twice, Cut Once".</a> Slightly saddened and concerned for the future about the reports online about battery performance getting worse from iOS 5.0.1. I hope 5.0.2 isn't *too* quick getting released.
