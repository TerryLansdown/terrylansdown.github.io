Okay, I knew I&#8217;d have a few hours free while on the move so I thought I&#8217;d rent a Film from iTunes (hey, why not!). Downloaded the movie to a Mac at home. <br /><br /><strong>Fail 1. </strong>Home sharing is on on all my machines, no sign of the download on my iPad or the machine I sync with the it. <br /><br />Copied it to the Mac I sync with my iPad, selected the option to move it to the iPad from iTunes, with the peculiarly-required Internet connection in place. The clock is now ticking as I needed to get moving with my day, weird I know. Sync&#8217;ed the iPad, anticipation of my investment in cinematic joy in store. <br /><br /><strong>Fail 2. </strong>iTunes tells me the film won&#8217;t sync because it&#8217;s been moved. Bah.<br /><br />As a user I&#8217;m not seeking to copy or steal content, I&#8217;d just like to view the film I&#8217;ve rented. I invested in the end to end product, Apple hardware and software &#8216;tightly integrated&#8217; to provide. Seamless user experience. <br /><br />I guess I&#8217;ll just buy a DVD next time and use Handbrake, which, of course, is excellent.
