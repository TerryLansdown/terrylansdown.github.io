The iOS5 split keyboard on the iPad is an excellent option to enable two-handed thumb-typing, which works great on an iPhone. It's just a little bit of a shame it was designed for aliens with thumbs below their little fingers. The anthropometry of the human hand would suggest the half keyboards were a bit higher up the screen.<br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong> fix for humans, the key is to press and hold the bottom-right keyboard button and then select 'Undock' before dragging the keyboard apart or selecting the 'Split' option.
