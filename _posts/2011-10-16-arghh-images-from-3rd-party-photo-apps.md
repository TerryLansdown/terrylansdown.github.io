A bit of initial testing, hope I&#8217;m wrong, but it looks like only the images collected by iOS apps get uploaded to the Photostream. The cutting of the cord, then makes it a right pain to get these orphans off the device. It no longer shows up in Aperture/iPhoto Image Capture. Using PhotoSync does the trick but you need to figure out what isn&#8217;t in the &#8216;stream&#8217;.</p> <p>Can&#8217;t seem to see a way to actually import the Photostream images either. I wonder what happens to them after the 30 days/1000 images limits get exceeded?</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> you can drag images from the Photostream to an Aperture folder, etc (whew!). </p>
