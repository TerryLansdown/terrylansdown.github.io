<p>Had a bit of idle time with the family in the shops. Decided to take a look at the current state of tablets. Disclaimer: I&#8217;m an iPad user since day one. Tried a few options:</p><ul><li>Arnova 8&quot; G2 - buttons designed for portrait, display defaults to portrait. Rotated the display thinking that it would flip, no luck. Did a bit of &#8216;bouncing&#8217; it up and down, no luck. Walked away.</li><li>MOTOROLA Xoom - couldn&#8217;t find the on button, I think, (and online searching suggests) its on the back, but the only likely candidate had a unlock padlock icon and didn&#8217;t work to switch the device on. Hunted for several minutes&#8230;and walked away.</li><li>BLACKBERRY PlayBook - blank screen. Now, starting to expect this, I dug around for the power button. I was surprised to see it was a tiny 2&#8211;3mm button on the top, slightly to the left of the centre of the device in portrait mode. Pressing with my finger I couldn&#8217;t press it down. Still pressing with my fingernail, I could press it down, but it still didn&#8217;t do anything. In slight despair at this point, I even asked an assistant for help. He kindly explained that device had crashed, force quit&#8217;ed the hung application, and returned it to the home screen. I didn&#8217;t catch what he did, even though I was looking. He asked if I would like further information. I said thanks, but I&#8217;d seen enoughâ€¦and walked away</li></ul><p>In summary, with no agenda, looking for iPad alternatives; all the ones I tried offered a bad experience. Maybe I missed the good ones, but after trying three...I walked away.</p><br />
