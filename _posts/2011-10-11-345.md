<strong>Situation:</strong> some little task you do repetitively, you recognise this is a waste of your time, and you can think of how to streamline your workflow to reduce, remove or optimise the task.<br /><br /><strong>Choice:</strong> do you:<br />a) invest the effort to reduce, remove or optimise it, or <br />b) live with the inefficiency knowing you've wasted no time on implementing a solution?<br /><br /><strong>My Approach:</strong> Almost always, I will invest the time to optimise now, for the long term fix. When I find myself doing this kind of thing, I coming round to thinking of the behavior as a '345'. Three hours of work in one sitting, for five minutes of daily benefit. On balance, I think this is good plan, but I do realise that the system has its productivity weaknesses, that need some careful consideration before creating a 345 or not.<br /><ul><li>how long will the tweak actually take? It's <em>always</em> longer than you think.</li><li>how often do you actually do this five minute task?</li><li>can you remember your fix if too much time passes before you use it again?</li><li>is it going to be <em>resistant</em> to task changes?</li></ul>
